# Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Trees

## Project Description
This repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook detailing a machine learning project aimed at predicting heart disease from clinical data using decision trees. The project utilizes Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, and scikit-learn for implementing and evaluating decision tree models.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: Analyze and visualize the dataset to understand the distribution and relationship of variables.
- **Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for modeling by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Building**: Construct decision tree models to predict heart disease. The process includes configuring various parameters like max_depth, min_samples_split, and min_samples_leaf to optimize model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and more. Further evaluation through cross-validation and GridSearchCV to fine-tune the model parameters.
- **Visualization**: Use tools like Graphviz to visualize the decision trees, helping in interpreting how decisions are made by the model.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to provide a predictive tool that can assist medical professionals in making informed decisions about heart disease risks based on patient data. The decision tree visualizations offer transparent insights into the model's decision paths, which are crucial for clinical support systems.

## Usage
